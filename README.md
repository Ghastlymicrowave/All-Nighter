# All-Nighter

## What is this?
All-Nighter is a self made "game jam" where we set our own time constraint and based it off of the [Famicase] (http://famicase.com/20/index.html) website, picking on of the carts to use for our theme. 

## Ideas/TODO
* Top down stealth based game where you are a vampire avoiding sunlight and combat systems.
* Combat systems could include:
  * sword slices (including upgrades to weapons: Think cleavers, katanas, etc.
  * dashes (including chained dashes)
  * guns (or a projectile that leaves behind shadows to cross large areas of light)
